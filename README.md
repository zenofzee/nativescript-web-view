# nativescript-web-view
proof of concept for a web based ui viewer

After checking out nathan walker's repo, https://github.com/NathanWalker/nativescript-angular-web-components
I just felt a need to put this up.


First. lets consider this, 
- It doesn't need to be complicated
- Not everyone uses or wants to be in the angular race (there maybe late comers etc) 
- Wouldn't it be nice to be able to view your nativescript ui in realtime as you write the xml for the ui? 
- how about no need to wait for your project to build and run on emulator/device to see if you actually did implement what you wanted? (functionality needs to be tested anyway.. but why waste time on ui.)
- this will be particularly helpful to beginners and ui bulders

This repo contains a simple proof of concept using xslt to transform nativescript xml based ui to run on a browser.
